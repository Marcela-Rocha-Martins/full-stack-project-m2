​
**Generate CVs on our Platform**
In our upcoming updates, we plan to introduce a feature that allows users to generate professional-looking CVs directly on the JobQuest platform. This will save users time and effort, enabling them to create visually appealing resumes that highlight their skills and experience effortlessly.
​

To provide users with a comprehensive overview of their job search activities, we intend to introduce a job application calendar. This feature will be integrated into the user's homepage, allowing them to view and manage all the jobs they have applied to in a structured and organized manner. Users will never miss an application deadline and can easily keep track of their progress.
